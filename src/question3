    3.Write a video player application with ‘Play’, ‘Forward’ , ‘Rewind’ functionalities. Please
    write pseudocode for this program and explain the design pattern you will use to develop
    these three functionalities.
        Ans:
            This program performs ‘Play’, ‘Forward’ , ‘Rewind’ functionalities for a video player app.

            declare the necessary variables


            function onCreate(Argument) {
                initialize the UI components and
                initialize currentTime to zero.
                declare onClick Listeners for the buttons
            }
            function play{
                set the file path.
                start playing the file
            }
            function forward{
                    currentTime= currentTime+15
                    play()
            }
            function rewind{
                    currentTime= currentTime-15
                    play()
            }


    I will be using decorator design pattern to build this entire application. Because the
    decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
    Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
